Searching algorithm are those that set out to find a target value.
In addition to the value, they might also provide details on how to get to it.
Searching is often synonymous with traversal.

## To-do

- Searching
  - Sliding-window
  - Iteratively-Deepening Depth-First Search
  - Best-First Search
    - Dijkstra
    - A\*
    - Iteratively-Deepening A\*
    - JPA\*
    - ...
  - Graph: Minimum-Spanning-Tree
- When to use each algorithm!
