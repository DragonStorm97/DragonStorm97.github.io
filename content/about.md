Who am I, and what even is a CataByte?

## Me - Johnathan Jacobs

I am an experienced engineer, with over 8 years of experience
in the banking and data space.
I have worked in data, front-end, and back-end development.
`C++` and `golang` are probably my two favourite languages,
though I appreciate a robust type-system so `rust` and `ocaml` aren't bad.

My hobby development mostly includes working on personal
game projects as that's what I find most exciting.
There's always some problem that will force you into hours
of research and deep-dives in search for the data structure
or algorithm that would best fit your use-case; and there's almost
always a need or opportunity to optimize a solution that other areas
(**cough** _the web_ **cough**) usually don't need.

Feel free to check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnathan-jacobs/),
or [GitHub](https://github.com/DragonStorm97) profiles.

## CataByte

CataByte is my personal project, my sole-proprietorship that I use for
my freelance work and commercial projects.

I hope to release a game under the name before the heat-death of the universe,
but I wouldn't hold your breath.
